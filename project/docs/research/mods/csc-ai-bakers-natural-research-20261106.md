# Timing a Bakers bid against natural civic research

Problem **1.6** tests whether a later district bid can survive native
preparation and reach construction. In the earlier isolated Delhi replay, the
AI reserved the intended tile, but its Craftsmanship request reached eight of
eight waiting turns and the district plan failed. The new world starts in the
Ancient Era with Craftsmanship locked. No civic, research boost, district or
building is granted. [Earlier bid and expiry](csc-ai-hotfix-live-bid-20261106.md).

## Read-only Online pilot

The shared controller hosted Small Continents at Prince and Online speed,
with the isolated CSC rules package and patched stock Gathering Storm. It used
the fixed Mill study leaders and seeds, with no diagnostic world setup or
instrumented writes. It recorded the original major AIs at turn 1 and each turn
from 5 through 25. Craftsmanship was locked for all five at turn 1.

| Original AI player | First observed researching Craftsmanship | First observed unlocked |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 8 | 14 |
| 2 | 8 | 12 |
| 3 | 9 | 15 |
| 4 | 7 | 11 |
| 5 | 9 | 19 |

The gameplay console exposed civic selection and unlock state. The initial
probe got no usable values there from the UI methods `GetCulturalProgress`
and `GetTurnsToProgressCivic`. The pilot stopped at turn 25 with zero writes,
no saved candidate, and verified restoration. These turn numbers describe this
world; they are independent of the earlier Delhi preparation fixture.

## What the game measures

On the fingerprinted Gathering Storm binary, `GetTurnsToProgressCivic` in
the UI cache binding at RVA `6ad720` forwards to the cached culture object's
indexed `GetTurnsLeft` at `0b3410`. The gameplay binding
`GetTurnsLeftOnCurrentCivic` at `6f0f40` forwards to the live player culture
method at `280770`. That method reads the active civic, calculates the current
culture yield, then passes both to `GetTurnsLeft` at `2806c0`. The latter uses
the civic cost and accumulated progress with the player's carried culture.
This result estimates turns at the current yield. Actual completion can
change with yield, boosts, or a different research selection.

`CultureAi::EstimatedTimeToResearch` at `414b20` reads a separate AI planning
row for the requested civic. It may add time remaining on the active civic
when the active civic matches neither of the planning row's two civic fields.
This is a distinct decision input. A short current-civic ETA establishes a
timing opportunity while the district tree's acceptance and persistence still
need their own runtime evidence.

The evidence root is `Desktop/Codex/csc-bakers-natural-20261106`. The first
pilot is `scout-01`; its `scans/` contain the per-turn records, and
`source-version/` retains the exact executed Lua and Python. Pilot
`scout-result.json` SHA-256 is
